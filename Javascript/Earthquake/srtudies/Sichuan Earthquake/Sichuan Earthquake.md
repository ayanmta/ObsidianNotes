## <p style="color:red"> damages</p>
1. The May 2008 quake flattened some <mark>_four-fifths_</mark> of the structures in the affected area
2.  officially reported total killed included more than 5,300 children, the bulk of them students attending classes.
3.  In addition, nearly 375,000 people were injured by falling debris and building collapses.
4. one city was completely flooded with mud and rock slide from mountains 

## what went wrong
- China didn't get an adequate seismic design code until following the big earthquake they had in 1976
- Particularly the poorer, rural villages in China were hardest
- There are very strong building codes in China, which take care of earthquake issues and seismic design issues. But many of these buildings presumably were quite old and probably were not built with any regulations overseeing them.

## challanges faced
- hilly regions were blocked by landside and rescue was difficult
- major landlides
- formation of quake lakes
- electric wires
- lack of modern equipments
